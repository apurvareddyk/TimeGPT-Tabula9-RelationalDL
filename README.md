# TimeGPT-Tabula9-RelationalDL

## Overview

This repository provides an in-depth exploration of advanced tools and techniques in time series forecasting, anomaly detection, synthetic data generation, and relational deep learning. By utilizing TimeGPT, Tabula, and RelBench, we demonstrate practical applications and insights that can benefit real-world scenarios, from forecasting Bitcoin prices to detecting anomalies in energy consumption data. Each Colab notebook includes step-by-step instructions, code explanations, and visualizations to ensure a comprehensive learning experience.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections, each containing multiple Colab notebooks. Each notebook link opens a unique Colab environment that allows you to interact with the code, run analyses, and view results.

### Repository Structure and Colab Links

- **TimeGPT** is a powerful tool for multivariate and long-horizon time series forecasting. In these notebooks, we apply TimeGPT to diverse datasets, enabling a comprehensive understanding of forecasting in areas like energy demand, cryptocurrency, and anomaly detection.
